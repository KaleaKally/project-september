STORY TEMPLATE FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY GAME
======================================

You can easily customize the story by editing the game.js file.
Look for the setupSimpleStory() function and modify the scenes.

Current Simple Story Structure:
-------------------------------
1. intro -> Introduction scene
2. scene1 -> Berlin arrival  
3. scene2 OR scene3 -> Forest or Tavern (based on choice)
4. scene4 -> Milan arrival
5. scene5 -> Duomo and crystal
6. ending -> Final birthday message

How to Customize:
-----------------
Each scene has:
- background: Choose from 'tavern', 'forest', 'berlin', 'milan', 'duomo'
- character: The name shown in dialogue
- text: Array of dialogue lines
- choices: null for linear progression, or array of choice objects
- next: Name of the next scene

Example Scene:
-------------
sceneName: {
    background: 'milan',
    character: 'Your Character',
    text: [
        "First line of dialogue",
        "Second line of dialogue"
    ],
    choices: [
        {
            text: "Choice 1 text",
            next: 'scene2'
        },
        {
            text: "Choice 2 text", 
            next: 'scene3'
        }
    ]
}

Tips:
-----
- Keep scenes short (2-4 lines of text)
- The game supports branching paths with choices
- You can loop back to previous scenes
- End the story by setting next: 'end'
